## println("Hello world");

## // My name is Vojtěch Mareš

I'm from Czech Republic and I am software engineer, freelancer. I am fluent in English (I have [CAE](https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams-and-tests/advanced/) to prove it). I have been programming professionaly for about three years. Mostly I work on backend, but I can do some frontend magic too. I develop web apps in PHP, also I like other programming languages such as Go and Java. Personaly I am a fan of Vue.js, but maybe a sneak peak to React would be a good thing. I love cloud, create computing (and other) resources as you need them and destroy them when you no longer do. Also, I do not write as much code as I did a year ago, because I am implementing DevOps practices to companies as a third party consultant. In a few weeks I will be kicking off my first training on Git and GitLab CI.
