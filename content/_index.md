## println("Hello world");

## // My name is Vojta Mare≈°

I'm from Czech Republic and I am software engineer, freelancer and devops consultant. I am fluent in English (C1). I have been programming professionaly for about three years. 

Mostly I work on backend, but frontend is not new to me. I write web apps in PHP. On the other hand, I would love to write Go or Java for production. Personaly I am a fan of Vue.js. I love cloud approach, create computing (and other) resources as you need them and destroy them when you no longer do. 

Also, I do not write as much code as I did a year ago, because I am helping companies to get started with DevOps practices as a third party consultant. In a few weeks I will be kicking off my first training on Git and GitLab CI.
