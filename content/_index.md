## println("Hello world");

## // My name is Vojtech Mares

I'm from Prague, Czech Republic and I am DevOps and Software engineer.

_I can't wait to attend this years KubeCon Europe!_

Currently I work for [GLAMI](https://www.glami.cz/) as MLOps/DevOps engineer. We run workload on Kubernetes and we are in the process of migrating everything to Kubernetes including training of ML models.

I really like DevOps, Kubernetes and along the way I fell in love with Golang.
